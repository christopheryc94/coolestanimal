	<h1>Lions are the coolest animal</h1>

	<h2>Why are they the coolest?</h2>

	<p>
		They're the coolest because they're the king of the jungle! They lead herds and the animal kingdom, they have no predator. Even though the lion is sometimes referred to as the “king of the jungle,” it actually only lives in grasslands and plains. The expression may have come from an incorrect association between Africa and jungles or may refer to a less literal meaning of the word jungle.

		Plus they have really cool mane's, and that's cool. A lion’s roar can be heard from as far as 5 miles away. The lion was once found throughout Africa, Asia and Europe but now exists only in Africa with one exception. The last remaining Asiatic lions are found in Sasan-Gir National Park in India, which was primarily created to protect the species. Currently, there are approximately 350-400 lions in the park.

		A lion may sleep up to 20 hours a day. A lion’s heels don’t touch the ground when it walks. A good gauge of a male lion’s age is the darkness of his mane. The darker the mane, the older the lion.
